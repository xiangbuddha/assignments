# Attend a workshop/event outside of class
### HIST 5152 Reflections Assignment

## About this assignment
Hands-on experience really is the best way to learn how to work with digital tools. We will work on small skills-oriented projects in our Lab during class, but this is a chance for you to engage with a topic or tool that is interesting or important to you personally in a structured, supportive environment.

### Due date
Due by November 28, 2022.

## Directions
1. Check out the Events calendar I've set up for this class to find a topic that you might be interested in. If you find one that isn't listed on the calendar, run it by me;  but it should be fine with me if you go to one of those, instead.
2. Once you've identified your event, make sure to register if necessary and check to see if you might need to prepare anything beforehand (sometimes, you might need to install some software or download a dataset or something along those lines to follow along in the workshop.) 
3. Then, make sure to attend it! Take notes along the way to help aid in your reflection process later.
4. Create a brief recap of the workshop/event answering the questions below.
5. Submit your materials.

## Guidelines for the recap
The recap can take the form of a written essay, a video, a screen recorded demo, an infographic, blog post, or just about any other medium you prefer. In your recap, briefly explain (in no more than 1250 words/ 10 minutes):

1. The name, date, topic, organizer, and other basic details of the workshop.
The workshop I joined is Black Beyond Data Reading Group on November 18.The topic of this workshop was The relationship between women's dress and fashion magazines in the black community. In this lecture, Prof.Autumn Womack presents data analysis of the development of black aesthetics between the 1880s and 1930s and the number of different types of fashion magazines sold in the black community.She proposes that in the early 1980s, the differences between the aesthetics of black women and white women were vast compared to today. Influenced by Islam, black Muslim women preferred to wear the hijab as well as the burka to follow the rules of their religion. The black female (especially Muslim) community was more conservative than the white women who pursued bold and enthusiastic colors and styles in the 1920s - as a result, white fashion magazines sold very little in the black community. And, she suggests, there is a correlation between black women's dress and their income. As black women's incomes increased in the 21st century, black women's aesthetics began to move away from conservative styles and influenced the style of some white women.

2. The structure of the workshop: how was it organized (thematically, step-by-step, etc.)? Give details about any processes, lectures, or preparatory work that made up the workshop.
This workshop is conducted on zoom and is a repeat workshop. But the content is not repetitive each week. The topic of the workshop I attended was a discussion on black women's beauty and clothing.The workshop starts at 12:00 noon and ends at 1:00. Before the workshop starts, we need to read Dr. Womack's book *The Matter of Black Living: The Aesthetic Experiment of Racial Data, 1880-1930*.The workshop reminds us that we will focus on the introductory section.The presentation will last about 45 minutes and we will have 15 minutes for questions after the presentation. The discussion between the audience is entered in text form in the dialog box of zoom.Before the workshop starts, we can find out about the next workshop from the poster:[title]([https://www.example.com](https://lifexcode.substack.com/p/1118-dr-autumn-womack-joins-the-blackbeyonddata))
3. How was your experience? Did you learn something new? Were there things that frustrated you, and if so, how did you overcome them (or how might they be overcome next time)?
It was the first time that I had focused my attention on the field of black women, and I found that I was extremely new. It was fascinating to gain an understanding of the connections between religion and the clothing worn by Black female Muslims, as well as traditional Muslim women from the Middle East, as well as the variations and parallels that exist between the two. One of the points that struck me was the relationship between female Black Muslim clothing and politics. Acceptance and appreciation of Islam are possible within secular societies as well, despite the fact that secular societies may modify the fashion and aesthetic components of Islam. When contemporary politics and religion come into contact with one another, the female hijab frequently becomes a distinguishing feature of political movements. One example of this is when the Muslim female hijab was replaced by the American flag, and another is the controversy over feminism and freedom that followed the question of whether women should wear the hijab.
4. Did you come away with an example/prototype/work-in-progress? Include a link or screenshot if possible.
Unfortunately I didn't.
6. What advice would you give to someone else who might be interested in learning more about this same topic?
My suggestion is that in learning about the history of black Muslim women, we don't need to be particularly concerned about whether certain Muslim women actually dress as the Qur'an requires. In other words, instead of symbolizing the Muslim community, we need to understand that whether these women pass on secularized or religious clothing, they are Muslims themselves.
